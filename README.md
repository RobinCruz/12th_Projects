# 12th_Projects
## Crime_Predictor
This was my take on machine learning when I was first hit with the concept.
### Note :
This was a fun filled experience with no actual knowledge and resource of the machine learning community.

## Truck_Game
This is a Truck based game where the truck goes in a wrong direction and you have to navigate it to safety as long as you can.
### Note:
This was my 12th standard final project.
